# Royal Bike Taxi Android
Royal Bike Taxi for Android is essentially a taxi dispatch app for the bike taxi service in Savannah, GA.
It works much the same way as Uber does, with a few differences. 

1. User requests a dispatch and is connected to the nearest available driver.
2. Driver either declines, in which case the user will be notified and try the next closest driver,
or the diver accepts and is connected to the user. 
3. The user can see the driver as they approach, the driver can see the user’s location and movement as well.
4. The driver is in charge of ending the ride.

The project highlights some Android fundamental concepts such as:
-	Google Play Services (Map, Location)
-	Background Services
-	Foreground Notifications
-	Database (Firebase)
-	Battery and Data Efficiency
-	Themes, Navigation
-	Intents

The app needs finishing touches before being used for real. Such as being able to handle lost connections, checking for compatibility (Google Play version, location enabled, network connection), and minor cosmetic issues. 

Development is on hold indefinitely due to time constraints and job prospects. Factors that would affect the success of this app in market include:
-	No real demand for an Uber style app in Savannah for a bike taxi.
-	Most customers of RBT are tourists that would need to be aware of the app, download it, then use it. The current business scheme heavily relies on being in the right place at the right time, picking up rides from people who decide to get a ride when they “see” us. 
-	Only real demand would come from locals, locals whom already prefer the other bike taxi company in town because of their “pay what you want” business model generating cheaper local rides. 

Either way it was a fun app to make and it showcases my Android skills as of 08/04/2016
